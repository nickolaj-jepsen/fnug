    A single executable task with its configuration and automation rules
    
    Commands are the leaf nodes in the command tree. Each command has:
    - A unique identifier
    - A working directory (inherited from parent group if not specified)
    - Automation rules (merged with parent group rules)
    - An executable shell command

class CommandGroup:
    r"""
    Hierarchical grouping of related commands
    
    CommandGroups form the nodes of a command tree, allowing logical organization
    of related commands. Groups can define common settings that are inherited by
    their children:
    
    - Working directory - Children execute relative to parent's directory
    - Automation rules - Children inherit and can extend parent rules
    - File patterns - Children can add to parent's watch patterns
    
    # Examples
    
    ```python
    group = CommandGroup(
        name="backend",
        auto=Auto(git=True, path=["backend/"]),
