Fnug /_fnuk_/ is a command runner, well actually it's a terminal multiplexer (like [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)), but with a focus on running all your lint and test commands, at once, and displaying the result of those command. Confused? Watch the [demo](#demo)

## Features

- User-friendly terminal interface, with 100% support for both keyboard and mouse navigation
- Git integration, automatically select lints and tests that's should be run, based on what files have uncommitted changes
- Track file changes, and selects commands based on the changed files
- Terminal emulation with scroll back, for those really long error messages

## Installation

Python 3.10 or later is required.

[pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) or [rye tool](https://rye-up.com/guide/tools/) are highly recommended:

```bash
# Recommended
pipx install fnug
# (or with rye tool)
rye install fnug
# Via pip (NOT RECOMMENDED)
pip install fnug
```

## Usage

To start `fnug` you only need to run it in a directory with a `.fnug.yaml` configuration file (or with the argument `-c path/to/config.yaml`)

### Config

Fnug is controlled by a `.fnug.yaml` configuration file (or `.fnug.json` if thats more your speed).

#### Minimal example:

Runs a single commands (without autorun)

```yaml
fnug_version: 0.1.0
name: fnug
commands:
  - name: hello
    cmd: echo world
```

#### Git autorun example:

Uses git autorun to select commands (reselect by pressing "g")

```yaml
fnug_version: 0.1.0
name: fnug
commands:
  - name: hello
    cmd: echo world
    autorun:
      git: true
      path:
        - "./"
      regex:
        - "\\.fnug\\.yaml$"
```

#### Watch autorun example:

Uses file autorun to monitor the file system for changes, and select commands accordingly, can be combined with git autorun

```yaml
fnug_version: 0.1.0
name: fnug
commands:
  - name: hello
    cmd: echo world
    autorun:
      watch: true
      path:
        - "./"
      regex:
        - "\\.fnug\\.yaml$"
```
