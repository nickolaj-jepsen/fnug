Fnug /_fnuk_/ is a lint runner, well actually it's a terminal multiplexer (like e.g. [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)), but with a focus on running lint commands defined in a [`.fnug.yaml`](#config) file, and displaying the result of those command.

## Config

Fnug is controlled by a `.fnug.yaml`, a minimal example would be:

### Minimal example:

Runs a single commands (without autorun)

```yaml
fnug_version: 0.1.0
name: fnug
commands:
  - name: hello
    cmd: echo world
```

### Git autorun example:

Uses git autorun to select commands (reselect by pressing "g")

```yaml
fnug_version: 0.1.0
name: fnug
commands:
  - name: hello
    cmd: echo world
    autorun:
      git: true
      path:
        - "./"
      regex:
        - "\\.fnug\\.yaml$"
```

### Watch autorun example:

Uses file autorun to monitor the file system for changes, and select commands accordingly, can be combined with git autorun

```yaml
fnug_version: 0.1.0
name: fnug
commands:
  - name: hello
    cmd: echo world
    autorun:
      watch: true
      path:
        - "./"
      regex:
        - "\\.fnug\\.yaml$"
```

### Advanced example:
